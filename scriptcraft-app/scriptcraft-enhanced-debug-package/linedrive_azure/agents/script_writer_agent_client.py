        IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Generate a complete {word_count}+ word video script about "{topic}" right now.

        Write a comprehensive {style} video script about: {topic}

        CRITICAL LENGTH REQUIREMENT: For a {duration} video, you need EXACTLY {word_count} words minimum 
        (assuming 150-160 words per minute speaking pace). Scripts under {word_count} words will be rejected.
        
        FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
        - Single host speaking directly to camera/audience
        - No dialogue between multiple people
        - Host narrates everything personally

        Start writing the script immediately with an engaging opening hook.
        
        Create a DETAILED, COMPREHENSIVE script with:
        - Extensive, in-depth explanations (not brief summaries)

        - Real quotes, statistics, and specific examples
        
        MANDATORY: REAL TOOLS REQUIREMENT

        - Each tool mentioned MUST have its exact name and be currently available
        - Include complete, working URLs where applicable (e.g., "You can try ChatGPT at chat.openai.com")
        - Add YouTube search terms for each tool (e.g., "Search 'ChatGPT tutorial' on YouTube for more")
        - Provide installation commands for developer tools (e.g., "pip install openai")
        - Include pricing information where relevant (e.g., "free tier available" or "starts at $20/month")
        - MOST IMPORTANTLY: In the script itself, explain HOW TO GET each tool you mention
          * For web tools: "To get started, visit [URL] and create a free account"
          * For desktop software: "Download it from [URL] - installation takes about 5 minutes"
          * For APIs: "Sign up at [URL] to get your API key - they offer $5 free credit"
          * For browser extensions: "Install the extension from [URL] or search in your browser's extension store"
        - NO hypothetical or generic examples like "SomeAI Tool" or "AI Platform"

        - Detailed case studies and scenarios
        - SCRIPT INTEGRATION: Don't just mention tools - integrate acquisition steps naturally into your narrative
        
        CONTENT DEPTH REQUIREMENTS:
        - MINIMUM {word_count} words required for {duration} duration
        - Each major section must be 2-3 minutes of actual speaking time (350-500 words EACH)
        - Include extensive detailed explanations, not just bullet points
        - Provide 3-5 detailed examples for each concept with full explanations
        - Add comprehensive context, background, and thorough coverage

        - Conclusion: 2 minutes (300+ words with comprehensive wrap-up)
        
        The host should speak naturally and conversationally, providing extremely thorough explanations
        with multiple examples, detailed walkthroughs, and comprehensive coverage that would 
        genuinely fill the entire {duration} duration when spoken aloud at normal pace.
        
        CRITICAL: Do not just outline or summarize. Write the FULL DETAILED CONTENT with 
        extensive explanations, multiple examples, and comprehensive coverage.
