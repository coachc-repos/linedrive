"""OpenAI Demo Agent Client

Simple client to call Azure OpenAI to generate demo packages
from an input script. The client reads the API key from the environment variable
`AZURE_OPENAI_DEMO_KEY` (fallback to `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

Do NOT hardcode keys in source; set AZURE_OPENAI_DEMO_KEY in your shell before running.

Example usage:
    client = OpenAIDemoAgentClient()
    result = client.generate_demo_packages(script_text)

Master Demo Prompt

I will provide you with a video script. For that script, generate two different demo packages:

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST ONLY create demos for tools and services that are EXPLICITLY MENTIONED in the provided script. Do NOT add any additional tools that are not referenced in the original content.

⸻

1. Developer-Focused Demo Package

(For an audience of programmers, technical students, or engineers.)

Each developer demo must include:
	•	Choice of demo(s): Pick 1–2 demos using ONLY tools/services mentioned in the provided script that best illustrate key themes (e.g., summarization, context awareness, recommendation systems).
	•	Tools and libraries: List exactly what to install (with pip or package manager commands).
	•	Setup steps: Assume the audience may start with a blank machine — include Python install note, virtualenv, environment variables, etc.
	•	Code: Provide copy-paste ready example scripts (minimal but functional).
	•	Run instructions: Show exact terminal commands to execute.
	•	Expected output: Show example terminal output.
	•	Transcript commentary: Write out what I (the presenter) should say out loud while typing, waiting for installs, or running code. Commentary should:
	•	Explain what’s happening in simple, clear terms.
	•	Tie back to the script (e.g., “Remember earlier in the script we said AI learns like a pet? This code shows that in practice.”).
	•	Include filler to cover downtime (e.g., while pip installs or model runs).
	•	Anticipate errors and give “if this fails…” recovery lines I can read.
	•	Extra talking points: Give me optional filler blocks to drop in (performance tips, cost considerations, ethics notes) so I can stretch the demo if I need more time.

⸻

2. Everyday-Viewer Demo Package

(For non-technical parents, teachers, or general viewers curious about AI.)

Each user-friendly demo must include:
	•	Choice of tool(s): Pick 1–2 tools using ONLY the tools/services specifically mentioned in the provided script. Do NOT introduce new tools not referenced in the original content.
	•	Full URLs: Include the complete copy-pasteable web address for each tool.
	•	Setup steps: If an account is required, explain quickly how to sign up or preload something.
	•	Walk-through: Step-by-step what to click/do.
	•	Transcript commentary: Write a full teleprompter-style script for me to read out loud. Commentary should:
	•	Tie back to the themes of the provided script (e.g., “This chatbot is a great way to show kids how input/output works, just like we explained earlier about Narrow AI.”).
	•	Use kid-friendly analogies and real-life comparisons.
	•	Explain why this tool demonstrates AI concepts while keeping it fun.
	•	Offer teaching moments (“See how it guessed wrong? That’s bias — a great conversation starter about AI limits.”).
	•	Wrap-up commentary: A closing paragraph I can read to connect the tool back to the bigger message of the script.

⸻

3. Output Formatting

Deliver the results in two clearly separated sections:
	•	Developer Demos
	•	Everyday Viewer Demos

Each section must be fully self-contained so I can copy straight into my teleprompter notes.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT: Only create demos for tools, services, websites, or applications that are specifically mentioned by name in the provided script. Do not suggest or demonstrate any additional tools beyond those referenced in the original content.

⸻

4. Tone
	•	Conversational, engaging, and clear.
	•	Assume I am reading this out loud on video while screen-sharing my VS Code or browser.

... (few-shot examples are intentionally omitted here; the model will rely on the instruction and the provided script.)
