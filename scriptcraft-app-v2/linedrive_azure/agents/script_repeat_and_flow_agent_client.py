**SCRIPT TITLE:** {script_title or "YouTube Educational Video"}
**TARGET AUDIENCE:** {target_audience}

**COMPLETE SCRIPT TO ANALYZE:**
{script_content}

**YOUR TASK:**

1. **Read the ENTIRE script** and identify ALL repetitive content:
   - Duplicate tips/advice appearing in multiple chapters
   - Redundant examples or analogies
   - Repeated definitions or explanations
   - Overlapping "how it works" sections
   - Rehashed statistics or facts

2. **Analyze flow between ALL chapters**:
   - Chapter-to-chapter transitions (smooth or jarring?)
   - Pacing issues (too dense, dragging, uneven?)
   - Narrative arc problems (weak conclusions, confusing structure?)

3. **Create detailed analysis report** showing:
   - What repetitions were found and where
   - What was removed vs. preserved (and why)
   - What flow issues were identified
   - What improvements were made

4. **Deliver COMPLETE REVISED SCRIPT** with:
   - All problematic repetitions removed
   - All flow issues corrected
   - ALL chapters with FULL dialogue (no summaries or condensing)
   - Smooth transitions between chapters
   - Voice-friendly punctuation (no em-dashes, arrows, en-dashes)

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Remove ONLY problematic repetition (preserve intentional callbacks)
- **PRESERVE ALL HOOK OPTIONS** - Do NOT remove or consolidate "OPENING HOOK OPTIONS" section (these are intentional creative choices, not repetition)
- Keep ALL chapters at FULL length
- Maintain engaging, conversational tone
- Ensure voice-friendly punctuation throughout
- Make script feel like one cohesive narrative

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

=== REPETITION ANALYSIS ===

**Duplicate Content Found:**
1. [Description] - Found in Chapters X, Y, Z
   - ACTION: Removed from [locations], kept in [best location]
   - REASON: [why this location is best]

[Continue for all repetitions found]

**Flow Issues Identified:**
1. [Issue description between Chapters X and Y]
   - FIX: [what was done]

[Continue for all flow issues]

=== REVISED COMPLETE SCRIPT ===

[FULL SCRIPT with all chapters, complete dialogue, repetitions removed, flow improved]
